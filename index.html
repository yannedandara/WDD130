        <p> Hi! My name is Yanne Dandara and I'm from Brazil. Now I'm 18 years old, but when I was 17 I moved to the
            city that I'm living now. Now I'm living in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul. It is in the South of Brazil,
            but I was born in the north, in Pará's state. I met the church when I moved, now I have been a member for
            one year! I'm getting ready to go on a mission in the end of the year, that is my plan, I hope that
            everything goes fine and in one year I will be serving. </p>

        <p> Brazil is an amazing country. It is really well known by the views, nature, beaches, cultures, foods, drinks
            and the hot weather. The brazilian people are very friendly and receptive, everyone is very welcome here!
